multiplecurrencies
==================
This extension is about adding multiple currencies in back-end for a product and displaying those in front-end. Normally magento allows price configuration at website, global and store level, but not at product level. My client wanted me to enter multiple currencies per product, so I had hack around a bit and successfully wrote this extension. 

There are certain prerequisites which should be satisfied before installing this extension. I've tried my best to omit programatical way of satisfying prerequisites because every guy/girl out there can't be coding gurus. 

Prerequisites:
==============
Multiple currencies should be allowed in drop down box in magento header. There is a simple procedure for this.
